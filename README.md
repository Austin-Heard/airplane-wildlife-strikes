# Initial Impressions and Questions
At what point do most wildlife strikes occur? Where do these strikes seem most prevalent (State, Airport, Rural vs City, etc.)? Is there any correlation between company and wildlife strike incidence? Does weather have any effect or is it seemingly coincidence? Do certain types of aircraft have more strikes?

# Potential Interests
What steps can be taken to avoid potential injury to personal or equipment? Where should more precautions be taken, or more thorough inspections take place to make sure strikes don't go unnoticed? Are any airlines particularly vulnerable to these attacks and potentially need to be put under more scrutiny?
